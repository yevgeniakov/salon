<p>The system implements the work schedule of beauty salon employees. There are roles: Guest, Client, Administrator, Hairdresser.<br>
The guest can see the catalog of services and the list of hairdressers taking into account sorting:</p>
<ul>
<li> by the name;</li>
<li> by rating</li>
</ul>
<p>can filter:</p>
<ul>
<li> by certain hairdresser;</li>
<li> by services.</li>
</ul>
<p>The client (authorized user) can sign up for a specific service provided by the hairdresser and for a specific time slot.<br>
The administrator can:</p>
<ul>
<li> view customer orders and change the selected time slot;</li>
<li> cancel order;</li>
<li> accept payment for the service.</li>
</ul>
<p>The hairdresser sees his schedule (busy and free time slots) and marks the execution of the order.<br>
After providing services, the Client leaves feedback. The offer to leave feedback comes to the Client's e-mail the day after the service is provided.</p>
